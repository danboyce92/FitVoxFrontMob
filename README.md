## Moving forward

**Template-Builder**

-Remove sets & reps from dummy data
-Create add exercise button top of Workout.tsx
-Need to create a modal that opens if the add button is hit,
-Modal should have a search bar in the top, and should display a number of different exercises.
-Add some to implement but more should be added later to fill in the variety.

## 08-06

Delete button should update state and also close modal when it is clicked for deletion of workoutplan. Currently it does neither.

## 13-06

Add new workout should create a new workout
Need to add functionality for changing name of currently selected workouts
That should be the last of this section, then move onto the record workout section
