## Moving forward

**Template-Builder**

-Remove sets & reps from dummy data
-Create add exercise button top of Workout.tsx
-Need to create a modal that opens if the add button is hit,
-Modal should have a search bar in the top, and should display a number of different exercises.
-Add some to implement but more should be added later to fill in the variety.

Delete button should update state and also close modal when it is clicked for deletion of workoutplan. Currently it does neither.
